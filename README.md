# MyQ

This is a fork of joeshaw's original work to update the device status output to be json.

`myq` is a Go package and command-line tool providing access to
the Liftmaster / Chamberlain MyQ API.

With the MyQ API you can get a list of devices and open and close
garage doors and gates.

## Command-line tool

The `myq` tool can be installed with:

    go get github.com/whirka/myq/cmd/myq

Run `myq` by itself to see full usage information.

To list devices:

    myq -username <username> -password <password> devices

To open a door:

    myq -username <username> -password <password> open <device ID>

To close a door:

    myq -username <username> -password <password> open <device ID>

Usernames and passwords can also be provided through the environment
variables `MYQ_USERNAME` and `MYQ_PASSWORD`.

## MyQ protocol

David Pfeffer's [MyQ API reference on
Apiary](https://unofficialliftmastermyq.docs.apiary.io/) was a helpful
reference.

David also has an implementation in Ruby:

ArrayLab has a Python implementation:

J. Nunn has a Python implementation that ties in with Amazon Alexa:
